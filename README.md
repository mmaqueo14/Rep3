# Paint, Snake & Pacman - Project

**Project Description:**\
	For the project we chose three of the games proposed: Paint, Snake, and Pacman. For each game we altered some of the features and used GitHub to update and organize our code. We created three branches, in addition to the main branch, where every person in the group made their modifications. This way everyone worked independently and in the end, we would merge all modifications and create our final code. 
	In the Paint game we completed the functions for circle, rectangle and triangle, added extra colors, added a new shape, set a modality to change width and made the canvas bigger. Each person in our group made at least one modification and we were able to complete the code together. 
	For the Snake game we added a function giving the user an option to change the speed of the snake, changed the colors, and enlarged tha playing space. 
	In Pacman, we decided to add more paths to the gameboard, changed the colors, increased the speed and added a gameover that occurs when you crash into a ghost.

**How to install and use software:**\
	In order to use the games, you must have Python installed and have the module freegames. You can either copy the code into the platform you wish to use or you can use a terminal and clone the repository. To do this you must use the command "git clone" and then copy paste the HTTPS link found in GitHub. Once you complete this step, you will have the ability to enter the repository from your terminal and execute the codes. By writing Python and the name of the code a new window will appear where the code will run. Play the game and have fun!

**Requirements for using software:**\
	- Having Python installed\
	- Having the module freegames if running from Thonny or other platform (For Windows users)\
	- If Apple user, download brew to install the necessary programs\
	- Having a terminal and knowing how to use it
